## Welcome to the Currency Trader Version 0.1
### This code solve the problem:
#### Someone wants to know what is the code from a country's currency.

## Countries that are in the list

#### To get the countries and their currency code I used the site: [Iban](https://www.iban.com/currency-codes)

## How the code works:
#### To get the informations about the country and the currency code I used the module [requests](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_requests.asp) to make an http request in the Iban site and then used the package [BeautifulSouop](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#getting-help) to scrape the page and get all the informations we need and then display the name of the country its currency code for the user

## Coming soon:
#### For the next steps to the Currency Trader, I want to create a simple webpage using Flask package that will get two countries from the list and how many currency the user wants to trade, so then display in a webpage the informations about the trade.
